# Kattis
This is a repository that has all my solutions to different Kattis problems. I mainly use python, but will try to include other languages for solutions as well. Kattis is a free online coding challenge wesite found at https://open.kattis.com.
Please don't just copy my solutions, but use them as a reference or place to start.
